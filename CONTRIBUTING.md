There are many ways to contribute to the streaming web. Building and sharing
Web Agent applications is a great place to start. Of course, we welcome
contributions to the Swim platform itself too!

Swim is a large software project, spanning several SDKs, written in multiple
programming languages. The first step to contributing to the platform is to
pick an SDK to work on

- [Swim Java SDK](swim-java)
- [Swim TypeScript SDK](swim-js)
