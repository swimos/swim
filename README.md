[SwimOS][swimos] is a full stack application platform for building stateful
web services, streaming APIs, and real-time UIs.

- **Stateful backend:** Build web service endpoints that continue to exist
  in-between operations. For every unique URI, run a lightweight, long-lived,
  general purpose compute process, called a Web Agent. Dynamically link
  Web Agents together to continuously synchronize their state. And use
  multiplexed streaming APIs to stream real-time changes to User Agents.
- **Real-time frontend:** Create live web interfaces that continuously
  synchronize application views with real-timed shared Web Agent state.
  Dynamically stream only what's necessary to update visible views. And
  efficiently render massive amounts of rapidly changing data with a UI
  toolkit built like a game engine.
- **Vertically integrated:** Built from first principles, the backend and
  frontend runtimes have zero transitive dependencies, and occupy only a
  couple megabytes on disk. The complete backend stack runs in a single OS
  process per server. And it's been proven at scale with hundreds of millions
  of concurrently running Web Agents handling millions of messages per second
  with millisecond latency.
