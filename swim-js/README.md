Swim is a full stack **streaming application platform** for building
stateful services, streaming APIs, and real-time UIs.

- **Streaming applications** push data through the full application stack,
  eliminating the need for polling.
- **Stateful services** remember what they're doing between operations,
  taking queries off the critical path.
- **Streaming APIs** publish differential state changes,
  streaming only what each client chooses to observe.
- **Real-time UIs** render live views of distributed application state
  that update with half-ping latency.

The **Swim frontend stack** provides everything app developers need to build
truly real-time user interfaces that run in any modern browser, including:

- A **foundation framework** for real-time applications that runs
  in Node.js and web browsers.
- A **streaming API client** for consuming multiplexed streaming APIs.
- A **UI engine** for efficiently rendering real-time user interfaces
  at high frame rates.
- A **UX toolkit** with reusable views and controllers tailor-made
  for real-time user experiences.
- Real-time **data visualizations**, including procedurally animated graphs,
  charts, and gauges.
- Real-time **map overlays** that display live geospatial visualizations
  on top of third-party base maps.
