/**
 * Non-blocking token stream writer. `Output` enables incremental,
 * interruptible writing of network protocols and data formats.
 *
 * ### Output tokens
 * Output tokens are modeled as primitive numbers, commonly representing
 * Unicode code points, or raw octets; each `Output` implementation specifies
 * the semantic type of its tokens.
 *
 * ### Output states
 * An `Output` writer is always in one of three states: _cont_​inue, _full_,
 * or _done_. The _cont_ state indicates that the stream is ready to write a
 * single token; the _full_ state indicates that the stream is unable to write
 * additional tokens at this time, but that the stream may logically resume at
 * some point in the future; and the _done_ state indicates that the stream has
 * terminated, and that [[bind]] will return the output result. [[isCont]]
 * returns `true` when in the _cont_ state; [[isFull]] returns `true` when in
 * the _full_ state; and [[isDone]] returns `true` when in the _done_ state.
 *
 * ### Output results
 * An `Output` writer yields a value of type `T`, obtained via the [[bind]]
 * method, representing some implementation defined result of writing the
 * output. For example, an `Output<string>` implementation may–but is not
 * required to–yield a `string` containing all code points written to the
 * output.
 *
 * ### Non-blocking behavior
 * `Output` writers never block. An `Output` writer that would otherwise block
 * writing additional output instead enters the _full_ state, signaling the
 * output generator to back off producing the output, but to remain prepared to
 * produce additional output in the future. An `Output` writer enters the
 * _done_ state when it encounters the final end of its output, signaling to
 * the output generator to stop producing.
 *
 * ### Output settings
 * An output generator may alter the tokens it produces based on its `Output`
 * writer's [[settings]]. Uses include pretty printing and styling generated
 * output. [[OutputSettings]] subclasses can provide additional parameters
 * understood by specialized output producers.
 *
 * ### Cloning
 * An `Output` writer may be [[clone cloned]] to branch the token stream in an
 * implementation specified manner. Not all `Output` implementations support
 * cloning.
 *
 * @see [[OutputSettings]]
 * @see [[Writer]]
