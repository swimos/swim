/**
 * Non-blocking token stream reader, with single token lookahead.
 * `Input` enables incremental, interruptible parsing of network protocols and
 * data formats.
 *
 * ### Input tokens
 * Input tokens are modeled as primitive numbers, commonly representing Unicode
 * code points, or raw octets; each `Input` implementation specifies the
 * semantic type of its tokens. The [[head]]  method peeks at the lookahead
 * token, without consuming it, and the [[step]] method advances the input to
 * the next token.
 *
 * ### Input states
 * An `Input` reader is always in one of three states: _cont_​inue, _empty_, or
 * _done_. The _cont_ state indicates that a lookahead token is immediately
 * available; the _empty_ state indicates that no additional tokens are
 * available at this time, but that the stream may logically resume at some
 * point in the future; and the _done_ state indicates that the stream has
 * terminated. [[isCont]] returns `true` when in the _cont_ state; [[isEmpty]]
 * returns `true` when in the _empty_ state; and [[isDone]] returns `true` when
 * in the _done_ state.
 *
 * ### Non-blocking behavior
 * `Input` readers never block. An `Input` reader that would otherwise block
 * awaiting additional input instead enters the _empty_ state, signaling the
 * input consumer to back off processing the input, but to remain prepared to
 * process additional input in the future. An `Input` reader enters the _done_
 * state when it encounters the final end of its input, signaling the input
 * consumer to stop processing. [[Input.empty]] returns an `Input` reader in
 * the _empty_ state. [[Input.done]] returns an `Input` reader in the _done_
 * state.
 *
 * ### Position tracking
 * The logical position of the lookahead token is made available via the
 * [[mark]] method, with optimized callouts for the byte [[offset]], one-based
 * [[line]] number, and one-based [[column]] in the current line. The [[id]]
 * method returns a diagnostic identifier for the token stream.
 *
 * ### Cloning
 * An `Input` reader may be [[clone cloned]] to provide an indepently mutable
 * position into a shared token stream. Not all `Input` implementations
 * support cloning.
 *
 * @see [[InputSettings]]
 * @see [[Parser]]
