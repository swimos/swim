# [![Swim](https://docs.swimos.org/readme/breach-marlin-blue-wide.svg)](https://www.swimos.org) Swim Recon Library

Recon is object notation with attributes—like if JSON and XML had a baby.
Attributes facilitate uniformly disambiguating polymorphic structures. And
first-class language extensions for selectors, expressions, and functions make
Recon a highly expressive format for domain specific languages.

## Language Overview

Recon combines the simplicity of JSON with the expressiveness of XML. As shown
in the example below, Recon looks a bit like a hybrid of the two. Yet Recon is
deceptively simple: the grammar for Recon is scarcely larger than the grammar
for JSON. And this underlying uniformity makes Recon more expressive, and more
consistent to work with, than either XML or JSON.

```recon
@html {
  @head {
    @title "Greetings"
  }
  @body {
    @h1 "Introduction"
    @p [I have @a(href:"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language")[markup syntax]
        for when you need it. But I'm not a text chauvinist. I'm a structured object
        notation first and foremost. The numbers {1, 2, 3} are parsed as numbers,
        not strings. Any my attributes make it easy to define, embed, and
        disambiguate microformats and domain specific languages.]
    @p [Need a microformat for time?  You'll find it falls out naturally after
        {{10 @minutes}} of using Recon. Need to build a DSL for real-time GUI
        widgets?  Recon helps you do so cleanly and concisely, like this:]
    @pie {
      title: "Events"
      linkStats: @link(host: "warp://traffic.swim.services", node: "swim:meta:mesh", lane: "linkStats", type: value)
      @slice {
        value: $max(0.1, $rate($linkStats.downMessageCount))
        label: @text($percent($value, $total))
        legend: @text([Down ({$round($value)}/s)])
        innerRadius: 10 + 7.5 * $value / $max($value) @pct
        outerRadius: 20 + 7.5 * $value / $max($value) @pct
      }
      @slice {
        value: $max(0.1, $rate($linkStats.upMessageCount))
        label: @text($percent($value, $total))
        legend: @text([Up ({$round($value)}/s)])
        innerRadius: 10 + 7.5 * $value / $max($value) @pct
        outerRadius: 20 + 7.5 * $value / $max($value) @pct
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The name Recon is shorthand for **Reco**rd **n**otation. Record Notation has
six primitive data types: _text_, _data_, _num_, _bool_ _extant_, and _absent_;
and one aggregate data type: _record_. Read on to learn about the underlying
structure of the language.

### Text Values

Text values take one of two forms: a quoted _string_, or an unquoted
_identifier_.

```recon
"string"
identifier
```

### Data Values

Binary data encodes as a leading '%' symbol, followed by a base64 literal.

```recon
%AA==
```

### Num Values

Numbers serialize as decimal literals.

```recon
-1
3.14
6.02e23
```

### Bool Values

Booleans are represented by the `true` and `false` identifiers.

```recon
true
false
```

### Extant Values

Extant symbolizes a thing that is defined, but which has no specific value.
Extant is represented by an empty token where a value is expected.

```recon
foo: # value of foo slot is extant
@bar # value of bar attr is extant
```

### Absent Values

Absent represents something that does not exist. Its only direct
representation in Record Notation is an empty document.

### Record Values

Record Notation has a single aggregate data type, called _record_. Records
play the combined role of array and associative array. Think of a record as
a partially keyed list—a sequence where some items may have keys, and other
items may lack keys. An array is a record in which no items have keys. An
associative array is a record in which every item has a key. An object is a
record where every item has a text key.

The example below contains a record with two ordered items, first a "subject"
field with value "Greetings", then the unkeyed string "Hello, Earthlings!".

```recon
{ subject: "Greetings", "Hello, Earthlings!" }
```

Items in a record are separated by a single comma, a single semicolon,
or one or new lines. Newline separated records provide a clean syntax
for pretty-printed documents.

```recon
{
  subject: "Re: Greetings"
  "Hi Martians!"
}
```

Records support arbitrary values as slot keys.

```recon
{
  @planet Jupiter: {}
  @god Jupiter: {}
}
```

### Blocks

Top-level documents can omit the curly braces around their root record.
The content of a record, sans curly braces, is called a _block_. When a block
contains only a single item, the value of the block reduces to the value of
the item it contains. The example block below is equivalent to the example
record with curly braces above.

```recon
subject: "Re: Greetings"
"Hi Martians!"
```
### Markup

Square brackets denote _markup_. Markup offers an inverted syntax for records,
with values embedded in text, as opposed to text embedded in records. Markup
looks like this:

```recon
[Hello, @em[world]!]
```

Markup is really just syntactic sugar for records. The above example expresses
the exact same structure as the example below.

```recon
{ "Hello, "; @em "world"; "!" }
```

Curly braces splice blocks into markup, lifting the enclosed block into the
markup's record. The following records are equivalent.

```recon
[Answer: {42}.]
{ "Answer", 42, "." }
```

Square brackets lift nested markup into the enclosing record. Make sure to
backslash escape square brackets if you want to include them verbatim.

```recon
[Say [what]?]
{ "Say ", "what", "?"}

[Say \[what\]?]
{ "Say [what]?" }
```

Sequential attributes within markup don't chain; each markup-embedded
attribute inserts a nested record.

```recon
[http@colon@slash@slash]
{ "http", @colon, @slash, @slash }
```

Attributes in markup can prefix curly brace enclosed blocks, as well as nested
markup.

```recon
[Goals: @select(max:2){fast,good,cheap}.]
{ "Goals: ", @select(max:2){fast,good,cheap}, "." }
```

Beware that whitespace inside markup is significant. There can be no
whitespace between markup-embedded attributes and the blocks they're intended
to modify. Notice how the single space added to the example below completely
changes its meaning, when compared to the previous example.

```recon
[Goals: @select(max:2) {fast,good,cheap}.]
{ "Goals: ", @select(max:2), " ", {fast,good,cheap}, "." }
```

### Attributes

The `@` sigil introduces an attribute. Attributes call out key fields of
a record. The markup `[Hello, @em[world]!]` further reduces to the form below.

```recon
{
  "Hello, "
  {
    "@em":
    "world"
  }
  "!"
}
```

Note that the `@em` field above has no explicit value. Recon models
unspecified–but existent–values as _extant_. We say that the record
`@em[world]` has an _extant attribute_ named `em`.

Of course, attributes can have specific associated values too. Place attribute
parameters in parentheses following the attribute's name.

```recon
@answer(42)
@event("onClick")
```

The above attributes are structurally equivalent to:

```recon
{"@answer":42}
{"@event":"onClick"}
```

Attribute parentheses enclose a block, meaning attribute values construct an
implicit record when needed. An example, with its desugared equivalent:

```recon
@img(src: "tesseract.png", width: 10, height: 10, depth: 10, time: -1)

{
  "@img": {
    src: "tesseract.png"
    width: 10
    height: 10
    depth: 10
    time: -1
  }
}
```

Attributes _modify_ adjacent values. Modified values interpolate into the
record formed by their adjacent attributes. Here are some examples of values
with prefix, postfix, and circumfix attributes:

```recon
@duration 30
30 @seconds
@duration 30 @seconds
@relative @duration 30 @seconds
```

The above attribute expressions desugar to the following records:

```recon
{ "@duration":, 30 }
{ 30, "@seconds": }
{ "@duration":, 30, "@seconds": }
{ "@relative":, "@duration":, 30, "@seconds": }
```

Modified records flatten into the record formed by their adjacent attributes.
So `@point{x:0,y:0}`, reduces to `{"@point":,x:0,y:0}`, not
`{"@point":,{x:0,y:0}}`.

## API Overview

**@swim/recon** uses [**@swim/structure**][structure] as its default abstract
syntax tree. Refer to the documentation for **@swim/structure** to learn how
to manipulate parsed Recon structures.

The `Recon` factory class provides static methods for parsing and serializing
Recon structures. Use `Recon.parse` to parse a **@swim/structure** `Value` from
a string:

```typescript
Recon.parse("[Welcome @a(href:'index.html')@em[home].]");
```

Use `Recon.toString` to serialize a structured `Value` to a Recon string:

```typescript
Recon.toString(Record.of("a", Slot.of("b", 2), "c"));
// "{a,b:2,c}"
```

Use "Recon.toBlockString" to write a top-level block when serializing documents:

```typescript
Recon.toBlockString(Record.of("a", Slot.of("b", 2), "c"));
// "a,b:2,c"
```

**@swim/recon** also adds extension methods to **@swim/structure** to make
parsing and serializing Recon more convenient.

The `Value.parseRecon` static method is an alias for `Recon.parse`.

```typescript
Value.parseRecon("[Hello, @em[world]!]");
```

The `Item.toRecon` and `Item.toReconBlock` instance methods delegate to
`Recon.toString` and `Recon.toBlockString`, respectively.

```typescript
Record.of("Hello, ", Record.of(Attr.of("em"), "world"), "!").toRecon();
// "[Hello, @em[world]!]"
```

Invoke `Item.toLike` to convert parsed Recon structures to plain old JavaScript
objects:

```typescript
Value.parseRecon("1, 2, 3").toLike();
// [1, 2, 3]

Value.parseRecon("a: 1, b: 2, c: 3").toLike();
// {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

Value.parseRecon("[Hello, @em[world]!]").toLike();
// ["Hello, ",{"@em":null,"$1":"world"},"!"]
```

`Recon` also provides methods to get composable [**@swim/codec**][codec]
`Parser`s and `Writer`s for low-level parsing and serialization needs, such as
incremental parsing out of arbitrary `Input` streams.

The exported `ReconParser` and `ReconWriter` classes can be extended to
directly generate and serialize alternative syntax trees, or to extend the
Recon language itself by overriding parse methods. `ReconStructureParser` and
`ReconStructureWriter` provide the standard **@swim/structure**-based
`ReconParser` and `ReconWriter` implementations, with full support for Recon
selectors, expressions, and functions.
